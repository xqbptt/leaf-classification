# leaf-classification
This is the winning submission for Invicta 2020, an Image Processing hackathon organised by Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati.

The problem statement had two levels: <br>

<b>LEVEL 1:</b> <br>
Following image was given, and the leaves in it were to be classified as fresh or old.

<br>
<b>OUTPUT FOR LEVEL 1</b> <br>
The output generated shows the percentage freshness in each leaf
<br>

<b>LEVEL 2:</b> <br>
An image of an ideal leaf was given along with a test image containing a bunch of other leaves of same specie.<br>
For each leaf in the test image, the percentage similarity with the ideal image was to be predicted. <br>
There were two testcases, one for maple leaf and other for neem leaf.
